# Dynamic Registration System

Welcome to the Dynamic Registration System project, developed during my internship with Bharat Intern. This project demonstrates a user-centric approach to registration using HTML, CSS, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.

## Features

- **Secure Registration:** New users can securely register, and their details are stored safely in MongoDB.
- **Personalized Home Page:** After registration, users land on a personalized home page.
- **Smart Error Handling:** Prevents duplicate registrations by guiding users to register with unique details.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express
- **Database:** MongoDB

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/dynamic-registration-system.git

2. **Install dependencies:**

```bash
cd dynamic-registration-system
npm install
```
3. **Set up MongoDB:**

- Ensure MongoDB is installed and running locally or on a cloud service.
- Configure database connection in config.js.

4. **Run the application:**

```bash
npm start
```
The application should now be running on http://localhost:3000.

5. **Explore the application:**

- Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:3000 to see the registration system in action.
